Matrix Inverse using Gauss-Jordan Elimination in C

This program computes the inverse of a square matrix using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method.

Features

Supports n×n square matrices (up to 10×10 by default).

Handles non-singular matrices.

Detects if the matrix is singular (non-invertible).

Menu-free simple input-output program.



Input Format

First, enter the size of the square matrix (n).

Then, enter n×n elements row by row.



Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n³) — due to Gauss-Jordan elimination.

Space Complexity: O(n²) — for storing matrix and inverse.

Graph Algorithms in C

This program implements the following graph-related operations:

Graph Input in SIF (Simple Interaction Format)

Single Source Shortest Path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

All-Pairs Shortest Path using Floyd–Warshall Algorithm

It uses an adjacency matrix representation and supports weighted graphs.

Features

Read graph edges from SIF format (e.g., A B 4)

Generate adjacency matrix automatically

Run Dijkstra to compute shortest path from a given source

Run Floyd–Warshall to compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

Handles INF (no edge) properly

Time & Space Complexity

Dijkstra: O(V^2) (matrix-based, can be optimized to O((V+E) log V) using heap)

Floyd–Warshall: O(V^3)

Space Complexity: O(V^2)

AVL Tree Implementation in C

This program implements an AVL Tree (self-balancing Binary Search Tree) with insert and delete operations, and provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Features

Insertion of nodes while maintaining AVL balance.

Deletion of nodes with automatic balancing.

Rotations: Left Rotate, Right Rotate, Left-Right, Right-Left.

Preorder Traversal to view the tree structure.

Menu-driven user interaction.


Menu Options
--- AVL Tree Operations ---
1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Preorder Traversal
4. Exit


Time & Space Complexity

Insertion: O(log n)

Deletion: O(log n)

Traversal: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) for tree nodes + O(log n) recursion stack

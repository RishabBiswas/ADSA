Compare Complexity Program takes the input as size of array(No of Elements to be entered for plotting map)

Once the input(No of array Elements) is given, It takes array elements(n) as input, In the backend, the code computes the function values 

The Function values are plotted against n.

The graph can be used for arranging the functions in increasing order.
